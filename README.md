This project aims to develop an SMS spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The system utilizes Logistic Regression as the classification model and TF-IDF for feature extraction from the text data. The SMS dataset is preprocessed by converting text to lowercase and removing punctuation and stop words. A Flask-based web application is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for inputting SMS messages and receiving real-time predictions. The system demonstrates the feasibility of applying NLP techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and TF-IDF, for effective SMS spam classification.
